# ProbablisticKNN
Machine Learning model that uses the KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm

The input vector(s) for the training data/test input can be any number of dimensions (any cardinality) provided that the cardinality of all of them are the same (if one is off, an exception will be raised).

See the example file for more details.
